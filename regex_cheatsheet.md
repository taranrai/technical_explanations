1. **Basics**:
   - `.`: Any character (except newline)
   - `^`: Start of string/line
   - `$`: End of string/line
   - `*`: Zero or more occurrences of the preceding character
   - `+`: One or more occurrences of the preceding character
   - `?`: Zero or one occurrence of the preceding character
   - `{n}`: Exactly n occurrences of the preceding character
   - `{n,}`: At least n occurrences of the preceding character
   - `{n,m}`: Between n and m occurrences (inclusive) of the preceding character
   - `|`: Alternation (OR)
   - `[abc]`: Character set (matches any single character in the set)
   - `[^abc]`: Negated character set (matches any single character NOT in the set)
   - `\\`: Escape character (for special characters like ., *, +, etc.)

2. **Predefined character classes**:
   - `\\d`: Digit [0-9]
   - `\\D`: Non-digit
   - `\\w`: Word character [a-zA-Z0-9_]
   - `\\W`: Non-word character
   - `\\s`: Whitespace [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]
   - `\\S`: Non-whitespace

3. **Grouping and Capturing**:
   - `(...)`  : Capture group (captures the matched content for later use)
   - `(?:...)`: Non-capturing group (groups the content without capturing)
   - `\\n`    : Backreference to the nth captured group

4. **Lookaround assertions**:
   - `(?=...)`: Positive lookahead (asserts the content follows the current position)
   - `(?!...)`: Negative lookahead (asserts the content does NOT follow the current position)
   - `(?<=...)`: Positive lookbehind (asserts the content precedes the current position)
   - `(?<!...)`: Negative lookbehind (asserts the content does NOT precede the current position)

5. **Difficult examples**:
   a) Matching an email address:^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$


Explanation: This regex matches an email address by ensuring it starts with alphanumeric characters or specific special characters, followed by an "@" symbol, a domain name with alphanumeric characters and periods, then a period and a top-level domain with at least two alphabetical characters.

   b) Matching a URL: ^(https?:\/\/)?([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]+(\/[\w- ;,./?%&=]*)?$
   
   Explanation: This regex matches a URL by optionally starting with "http://" or "https://", followed by one or more subdomains with alphanumeric characters and hyphens separated by periods, then a domain name with alphanumeric characters and hyphens, and an optional path with various allowed characters.

   c) Matching balanced parentheses: ^\((?>[^()]+|(?R))*\)$
  
   Explanation: This regex uses recursion to match balanced parentheses. It starts and ends with a pair of parentheses and can contain any characters except parentheses, or it can recurse and match another balanced pair of parentheses.

 Remember that these examples may not cover all edge cases and could be further optimized or modified depending on the specific requirements of your use case.
