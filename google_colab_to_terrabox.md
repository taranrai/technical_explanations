# To connect Google Colab to TerraBox, you can follow these steps:

1. First, create a new TerraBox account if you don't already have one. You can do this by visiting the TerraBox website and signing up for an account.
2. Next, log in to your TerraBox account and create a new project. You will need to give your project a name and choose a location for it.
3. Once you have created your project, you will need to generate an API key. To do this, go to the "API Keys" tab in your project settings and click the "Generate New API Key" button. Copy the API key to your clipboard.
4. Now open a new Google Colab notebook and run the following code to install the ```terrascript``` and ```google.colab``` packages:

```
!pip install terrascript
!pip install google.colab
```
5. Next, you will need to authenticate your Google Colab notebook with your TerraBox account. Run the following code and follow the instructions to authenticate:

```
from google.colab import auth
auth.authenticate_user()
```
6. Once you have authenticated, you can use the ```terrascript``` package to create and manage your TerraBox infrastructure from within your Colab notebook. To get started, create a new Python cell and import the ```terrascript``` module:

```
import terrascript
```
7. Now you can start defining your TerraBox infrastructure using the ```terrascript``` module. For example, to create a new EC2 instance, you can run the following code:

```
from terrascript import Provider, Resource
from terrascript.aws import aws

terraform = terrascript.Terrascript()

terraform += Provider('aws', access_key='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', secret_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY', region='us-east-1')

terraform += Resource('aws_instance', 'example_instance', 
    ami='ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0', 
    instance_type='t2.micro',
    key_name='example_key_pair',
    security_groups=['example_security_group']
)

print(terraform.dump())
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual TerraBox API key.

8. Finally, you can run the Terraform code from within your Colab notebook by using the ```terrascript.apply()``` function:

```
from terrascript import apply
apply(terraform)
```
This will create the new EC2 instance in your TerraBox project. You can monitor the progress of the deployment in the TerraBox web console.
